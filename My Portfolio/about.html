    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Aditya Raj, a passionate B. Tech
      student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Haldia Institute
      of Technology. I am currently in my 3rd year of studies and have
      maintained an average CGPA of 9.1 until the 5th semester.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a young age, I have been captivated by the world of technology and
      its ever-expanding possibilities. As a result, I have developed a strong
      skill set in web development, SQL, and C++. These skills have allowed me
      to bring my ideas to life and create innovative solutions to real-world
      problems.
    </p>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Outside of academics, I have a few hobbies that keep me balanced and
      inspired. I find great joy in playing cricket and football, as they not
      only provide a healthy outlet for my competitive spirit but also teach me
      valuable lessons in teamwork and discipline. Additionally, I am an avid
      fan of web-series and movies, as they allow me to explore different
      narratives and immerse myself in diverse storytelling.
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey as a web developer has been a thrilling one so far, and I look
      forward to taking on new challenges and collaborations in the future.
      Through this portfolio website, I aim to showcase my skills, projects, and
      experiences, while also providing a glimpse into who I am as an
      individual.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work.
      Feel free to reach out to me for any opportunities, collaborations, or
      simply to connect. Let's embark on this exciting technological journey
      together!
